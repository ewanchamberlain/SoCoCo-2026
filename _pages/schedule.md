## Talks
### Sam Philipsborn
*University of Sussex*\
**Towards an empirical halo mass function with 4MOST**\
4MOST is a new multi-fibre spectroscopic instrument that has just finished commissioning. Installed on VISTA in Paranal, 4MOST has 2436 fibres that will gather the spectra of ~25 million targets over 5 years. Given 4MOST's unique observing strategy, where different surveys share the focal plane, not all these targets are cosmological. In this talk I will give a brief overview of the 4MOST instrument and consortium, and present on some of the cosmological science goals. I will pay particular attention to the WAVES survey, the successor to GAMA, and how we may derive an empirical halo mass function from the upcoming dataset once the 4MOST data has been collected. 

### Nastassia Grimm
*University of Portsmouth*\
**Model-independent tests of gravity with the Weyl potential evolution**\
Cosmological observations are well described by the LCDM model, a universe with a cold dark matter component and a cosmological constant acting as dark energy. However, more and more cosmological tensions have emerged in the past decades, putting this simple model into question. A large amount of research has focused on the quest for an alternative model of modified gravity and dark energy, but no consensus has been reached. Model-independent tests of gravity can help us to identify viable models while keeping the computational cost of data analysis minimal. In this talk, I will focus on the Weyl potential evolution, a model-independent observable tracking the combined gravitational potential Ψ + Φ. I will present a measurement of this quantity obtained using galaxy-galaxy lensing and galaxy clustering data from the Dark Energy Survey. I will also highlight how, in combination with redshift-space distortions, this new observable can help us to disentangle different alternative models.

### Chris Byrnes
*University of Sussex*\
**Introducing primordial black holes**\
While black holes are typically known as the remnants of stellar collapse, some may have formed in the early universe—these are known as primordial black holes (PBHs). Unlike most dark matter candidates, primordial black holes do not require the introduction of new fundamental physics, making them a compelling possibility. In this talk, I will outline the current observational constraints on PBHs as dark matter, explore their potential connections to gravitational wave signals, and discuss how Hawking evaporation of light primordial black holes could produce high-energy particles.

### Robson Christie
*University of Portsmouth*\
**Inflationary False Vacua: Decoherence and Non-Adiabatic Dynamics**\
We explore the dynamics of a scalar field in an asymmetric quartic double-well potential during inflation, focussing on the interplay between vacuum selection and environmental decoherence.  Our model consists of a real scalar field linearly coupled to environmental degrees of freedom, as well as stochastic fluctuations from short-wavelength modes crossing the Hubble scale, enabling a systematic derivation of both Markovian and non-Markovian master equations. Due to the complexity of the resulting dynamics, we rely on numerical solutions to explore the behaviour of this system.

### Theo Steele
*University of Sussex*\
**An efficient model of cosmology dependence in the covariance matrix of the matter power spectrum**\
We develop an efficient model for estimating the parameter dependence of the covariance matrix of the matter power spectrum by Taylor expanding around a known value of the parameter space.  This method allows us to use a relatively small number of input cosmologies, specifically one fiducial cosmology and two further cosmologies for each parameter.  We explicitly calculate the covariance matrices for these cosmologies and then develop a new model that allows us to interpolate from these the form of the covariance matrix with a cosmology that is located elsewhere in that given parameter space without explicit calculations of perturbation theory.  This method speeds up covariance matrix calculations in new cosmologies by orders of magnitude compared to explicit perturbation theory calculations at each point in a given parameter space.

### Nathan Cruickshank
*University of Portsmouth*\
**Constraining Momentum Exchange in the Dark Sector**
Interactions between dark energy and dark matter offer a potential solution to cosmological tensions. Specifically, models characterised by pure momentum exchange have been suggested to alleviate the S8 tension, as they lead to a suppression in structure growth rate at late times. In this talk, I will discuss how the choice of dark energy model impacts the ability of future data releases to constrain the coupling strength of these interactions. I show that to obtain robust constraints, it is crucial to account for dark energy perturbations when computing the linear matter power spectrum, particularly in the limit where the equation of state w approaches -1.

### Raphael Kou

**Unified dark fluid with null sound speed as an alternative to phantom dark energy**\
"Recent BAO measurements from DESI show a mild preference for an evolving dark energy equation of state entering a phantom regime, w<−1, when interpreted within the standard CPL parameterization. Such a regime raises conceptual and practical difficulties, in particular for the consistent treatment of cosmological perturbations. We propose an alternative phenomenological description in which dark matter and dark energy are treated as a single unified dark fluid. In this framework, the background expansion history reproduces DESI's CPL best-fit without invoking a phantom component.
Assuming a vanishing rest-frame sound speed for the unified fluid, we study the resulting perturbations and find only small deviations in CMB and large-scale structure predictions on linear scales compared to the CPL case. We show that this unified model satisfies current observational constraints with a fit comparable to standard analyses, and therefore provides a viable and physically consistent alternative to phantom dark energy in light of current DESI results."
